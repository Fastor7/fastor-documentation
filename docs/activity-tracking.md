# Activity Tracking

Activity tracking helps you check the activity of your business. It shows all the changes made in real-time. Every change, order related queries and everything in between is updated here. 

There are many changes you can keep an eye on. These include all the changes done in a setting section. You'll also be notified here if there is a new user addition or if any details of existing users have been edited. You can also see the details of a deleted user.

The tracker also helps to overview every order action. You can also easily look for every offer addition or editing done here. If you have deleted an offer that is no longer active, you will be notified of that here as well.

You can easily track a new user as well as any changes to your business profile. Like store name or logo change.
