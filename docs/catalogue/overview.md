# Overview

The **catalogue** is your list of items, the products that you want to sell. Imagine a book and as you open it, you find on each page a heading followed by various items listed under that heading. That book is your catalogue, the heading is your **category** and the **items** presented are all the items that are offered under that category. For example, for a fashion catalogue, the category will be heels and one of the items would be Black Velvet Heels.
