# Product Variations & Add-Ons

For better product sales, you can add in **customizable variants and add ons**. A **product variant** means that with one item you can add multiple features such as size and type, thus offering different types of that single item. Example: A Pink Hawaiin shirt can also have another variant, A Blue Hawaiin shirt or XXL Flamingo Hawaiin shirt. The variant can also be another item with similar features, or more or less

As a vendor, you can also **add ons**. Add ons generally means offers or products with your initial item that you can offer to the customer. Others can be similar products with different price ranges or delivery dates. You can always innovate with your add ons to maintain the interest of the customer and serve them with multiple alternatives for a better shopping experience.
