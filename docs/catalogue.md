# Catalogue

 The **catalogue** is your list of items, the products that you want to sell. Imagine a book and as you open it, you find on each page a heading followed by various items listed under that heading. That book is your catalogue, the heading is your **category** and the **items** presented are all the items that are offered under that category. For example, for a fashion catalogue, the category will be heels and one of the items would be Black Velvet Heels. 

The **category** is the group of products that falls under a certain type that you are selling. For example- shoes, T-shirts, or any other type of product. Under these categories comes all of your **items**. How can you add another category? Simple. Click on the **New** option < add the name of your category and click on **Add**.

You can manage the products under one category. By uploading those products' images, along with variants as well as product type and description. 

For better product sales, you can add in **customizable variants and add ons**. A **product variant** means that with one item you can add multiple features such as size and type, thus offering different types of that single item.
