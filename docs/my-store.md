# My Store 

My store is the front page of your business or brand. That means that it shows the front face of your business or brand. Also, My Store is where you can put up the most recognising features of your business, like banners and your brand's logo. Before you start to dive into all the little details of your business, you need to set up your My Store profile. 

Your **store name** is the name of the business that you want to be known to your customers. Many things affect the way one chooses the name for their business. It might be sentimental or something unique or something entirely different from the business. However, each store or brand name is impactful and carries weight in itself. So, before you finalise your store name, remember that this is the first thing they'll say when they talk about your business, so whatever name you come up with, should be 100% impactful and related to your business.

Even the most basic business profile can have an impact with a memorable business **logo**. Take for instance every major brand and its logo, you will realise that the brand identity is directly connected to the logo and sometimes the logo is enough to have the character of the brand recognised among people.

You can also provide the store link on your **My Store** page. The link is essentially the web address to your online store where the customer can click on to explore your business in a detailed manner and take sale-related products and services. 

The **store banner** goes hand in hand with the store logo. The banner can be anything, from the display of your most prized product to a general message or even your brand's slogan, something that is unique to your business. 

Don't forget to put in your** physical store timing**. This way, your clients will know the working hours of your business and can easily form an idea about when to contact you for your services. 

You should also check the **view as a customer pop up** that is present on the right side of your screen when you click on My Store. It allows you to look at the way your business profile will be shown to your customer. You can easily see the change you do in My Store in real-time on this pop-up.
