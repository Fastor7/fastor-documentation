# Order History 

 You can check the details of all your previous orders here. You can look up the orders for up to the last 30 days. Order history helps you refer to previous orders and you can tally them up for any data or references.
 
You can easily refer to order via the order number as well as the date and number of items ordered. The list will let you know the status of the order as 'pending' or 'completed'.
