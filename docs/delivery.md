**Self-delivery** is when you as a vendor can deliver within a certain radius of distance, with the help of your staff. You can fill in the delivery charge and features such as **cash on delivery** and **free delivery** for certain orders. 

**Third-Party Delivery** is when you engage with a third party delivery partner. You can select a service provider from the given options.  You can choose who to charge for the delivery cost, between Merchant (you), customer or to **split the delivery charges (50/50)** between you and the customer. If you avail of third party delivery options, there will be charges deducted as payout, also with payment gateway charges. 

**Hybrid delivery **is when you as a merchant deliver for far off deliveries when the distance is outside the range of third party delivery providers range. 

You can click on the **Allow Free Delivery **box if the order amount is more than the minimum amount you set for the free delivery charge.
