# Analytics 

Analytics makes you analyse your business overall performances within a given time. You can check on the orders, payments as well as sales. There is a separate preference tab to help you track your business activities. 

You can easily look **total sale** that occurred, as well as the **average order cost**, meaning the average amount customers paid for, the **total orders placed** and the total amount of discount that you availed.

The **Order Graph** presents the way your sales have risen or fallen every month. There is also a separate section for **Payments** as well as the **Total Sales **of the last 30 days. You can filter out the time by clicking on the **Filter** option at, top right of the screen.
