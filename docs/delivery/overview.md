# Overview 

There are three types of delivery modes that you can avail for your customers. You can easily edit the delivery feature for the order under the **Settings** section. Click on the pencil-like icon and select the delivery type that suits best.

- You can click on the **Allow Free Delivery **box if the order amount is more than the minimum amount you set for the free delivery charge.
