# Offers 

Offers are the incentives you plan on gving to your cusomters, to boost your sales and brand value. They allow you to indulge with customers through reduced price and marking in a long term clientele with your customers. Offers attract traffic to your business and it's a foolproof way of boosting your brand's name.  You can further check all the active offers, which are still running as well as the inactive ones. 

## To create a new offer

Step 1. Simply click on **New Offer** 
Step 2. Fill in all the details, like offer title, type and description
Step 3. Add coupon details, if any 
Step 4. Add amount details if it's a price off kind of offer.

There are two types of **offer type**, **Discount** **in** **Percentage**, which means that a certain per cent discount is offered, ex- 50% off on shoes. 

Another one is the **Flat** **Discount**, which is the discount given on the total of a customer's purchase. For example, suppose a client buys products worth 10,000/- and he/she is eligible for a flat document through your offer of 25% off, the 25% off will be from the overall 10,000/- of the revenue, and therefore the customer is entitled to pay only 7500/-.

For coupons details, you can add the **code** that will be used by the customer. You can also set an expiry date for your coupons.  You can add a **minimum** and **maximum** value for your discount as well as the **discount** **limit**. For example, a customer can only get a particular discount if his total shopping purchase is more than 1500/-. That means the minimum value to avail of this discount is 1500/-.

Some offers can be **POS** **Only**, meaning Point of Sale only. So any offer marked as  POS  will only be visible to you as a merchant and it will not be visible to customers. POS Only are the offers that only you as the merchant can apply for.

You can **update an offer**, by clicking on the little pencil-like icon.

If you want to edit an existing offer, click the icon under the **Edit** section and fill in the new details.
